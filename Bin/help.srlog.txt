Welcome to SRLog, a Windows logging software that comes as a part of the SRCOM
software suite. This software is designed with simplicity, portability, and
functionality in mind. SRLog is open source and allows the following logging:

- 160m-23cm band logging support
- Contest support, including Field Day
- Satellite Contact Support
- Automatic hamdb pulling for names and QTH (toggleable)
- Automatic UTC Time
- Auto-Filled RST reports
- Search current and previous log files
- Check for duplicate contacts in the current and previous logs
- Export to ADIF for easy integration with your favorite logging service
- Automatically informs the user what their voice range is for their license
- Can be run over SSH
- One Keypress QRZ page opening

SRLog does not use the mouse at all, and is designed to be rapidly navigated with
the keyboard. It has an easy no-query mode for offline / quicker use.

Here are some tips and tricks for using the software:

- For callsigns starting with a W, K, or F, you can press that key on the keyboard 
  instead of 1 or C to save one keypress.

- When entering into any field, pressing enter without any content will not change
  the variable. In general, enter NONE to blank out a field.

- Avoid using special characters in notes and names as they can mess with the program

- Notes, Contest data, and Satellite mode is indicated under "SPEC" in the log list.
  S indicates Satellite work, C indicates contest data (State, Class, or Serial),
  and an N indicates there is a note.

- Exporting to ADIF can take a bit for long files.

- Make sure your system clock is accurate for UTC time to fill in properly

- Letter-based keybinds will not work as capitalized letters. Leave your caps lock off.
